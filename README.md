1. minStepsInInfiniteGrid.py ---> You are in an infinite 2D grid where you can move in any of the 8 directions : (x,y) to (x+1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1), (x-1, y-1), (x+1,y+1), (x-1,y+1), (x+1,y-1) You are given a sequence of points and the order in which you need to cover the points. Give the minimum number of steps in which you can achieve it.


2. addOneToNumber.py ---> Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits, add 1 to the number. The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

3. largestNumber.py ---> Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.

4. waveArray.py ---> Given an array of integers, sort the array into a wave like array and return it, In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5.....
